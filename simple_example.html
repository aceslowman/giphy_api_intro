  You will need to generate your own API key, and then swap the api_key in the
  ajax call below with your own. (line 52)

        Looking at the 'translate' section here (https://developers.giphy.com/docs/)
        you can see that we need to send our request to /v1/gifs/translate, using GET.

        there are also three request parameters:

        api_key: the key that we generated from the giphy dev site. this isn't a
        paid api, but they still have their conditions for use, which you do not
        want to disobey and have your api key revoked.

        s: the string that you would like to have translated to a GIF

        weirdness: a number betweem 0-10 that represents how 'wild' the results
        might be.
      */
